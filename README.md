#gantt_vacation


Simple wrapper site to keep track of who is on vacation, and show it in a gantt graph.

Uses http://taitems.github.io/jQuery.Gantt/ for most of the work, and stores the dates in a SQLite database.

##Installation :
```
git clone https://github.com/jvhaarst/gantt_vacation.git https://github.com/jvhaarst/gantt_vacation.git vacation
cd vacation
git clone https://github.com/taitems/jQuery.Gantt.git
```
Then point your browser to the directory.

If you want to keep old data, just copy that over.
